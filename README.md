# Top-crops-prediction
->In this project i have used supervised learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and XG Boost Regressor to train the model 
  and predict the production of crops in india based on its area, crop year, season,etc which can placed as input and outputs the production of that particular state.
->I have also used modules like seaborn, matplotlib and plotly for the data visualization of specific crops based on their highest yield in state, year, season and so on.
->Hope you all understand the abstact of it.
